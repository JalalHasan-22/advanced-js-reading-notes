# Readings: Ethics

### A. Ethics in the workplace

1. The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

The main Idea of this article that the writer is focusing on, is to write the code for a good purpose and not to trick the end users of the website or the application.

In the articel, the author speaks about one time where he was asked to develop a website for a pharmaceuticals company and within the website there was a quiz that will suggest a drug based on the user's answers.

The requirements of the website (the client) made it clear that their drug must be suggested as the best option to the users unless they say that they are allergic to it.
Later, a teenage girl whom was taking this drug passed away, as the drug had many side effects that included suicidal thoughts and depression.

I bleive that this relates to 'Ethics in technology' as you as a developer, you should always right code for good reasons, and never use this skill or knowledge to manipulate people or to direct them towards anwanted actions. never provide missleading information.

### B. Ethics in Technology

1. Self driving cars ethics

In this article, the author is discussing what should a self driving car do in a situation where it needs to take a crucial life-or-death desicion, as the development in the self driving cars industry is massively growing; this question is no longer considered theorotical. the ethical considerations is what we need to focus on in those situations more than the self-driving concept itself, this is what the author stated through the article and this is how it is relalted to the ethics in technology.
For example if the car faces a small object what should the desicion be in this situation ? What if this small object was a child ?
The ethical part in this situation means to keep in mind all of the situation where a car desicion may affect someone's life, might be the passenger inside the car, or might be other people who are using the road.
this should be kept in mind through the programming phase, and not that we deliver something working as a self driving car but is a disaster when it comes to desicion making that affects peoples lifes.
