# Reading: Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

## Component life cycle

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

### Mounting

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1. constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

constructor
The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component).

### Updating

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
2. shouldComponentUpdate()
3. render()
4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
5. componentDidUpdate()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

### Unmounting

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

- componentWillUnmount()

## the Effect Hook

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components.

Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

useEffect runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect.

This is not what we want. There are several ways to control when side effects run.

We should always include the second parameter which accepts an array.

### Effect Cleanup

Some effects require cleanup to reduce memory leaks.

Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners, and other effects that are no longer needed should be disposed.

We do this by including a return function at the end of the useEffect Hook.
